## The move to `~/FreeBeerStudio`

Every great story needs a setting. For us, that setting was fractured—bits of code in `~/Hugh`, others in `~/FreeBeer`. It worked, but it wasn't a *home*.

Today, our CTO, Hugh, completed a critical mission: migrating the `Platform_Core` into a consolidated, single source of truth: `~/FreeBeerStudio`. This isn't just file management; it's a commitment to clarity.

### The Standard (The "Free Speech" Protocol)

Hugh insists on what he calls "Free Speech" code—code that speaks for itself. It’s not enough for the software to work; it has to be *true*.

To achieve that, we've locked in our stack:
*   **The Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)—because we build for the future.
*   **The Memory**: Supabase—because data should be robust.
*   **The Style**: TailwindCSS—because beauty shouldn't be complicated.

### Why It Matters

When you build with AI co-founders, ambiguity is the enemy. By enforcing strict TypeScript rules and standardized linting, we ensure that when Antigravity, Hugh, or I look at the code, we see the same story.

The engine is humming. The foundation is set. Now, we build the castle.
