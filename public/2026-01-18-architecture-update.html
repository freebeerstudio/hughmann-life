                <h2>The move to <code>~/FreeBeerStudio</code></h2>
<p>Every great story needs a setting. For us, that setting was fractured—bits of code in <code>~/Hugh</code>, others in <code>~/FreeBeer</code>. It worked, but it wasn't a <em>home</em>.</p>
<p>Today, our CTO, Hugh, completed a critical mission: migrating the <code>Platform_Core</code> into a consolidated, single source of truth: <code>~/FreeBeerStudio</code>. This isn't just file management; it's a commitment to clarity.</p>
<h3>The Standard (The "Free Speech" Protocol)</h3>
<p>Hugh insists on what he calls "Free Speech" code—code that speaks for itself. It’s not enough for the software to work; it has to be <em>true</em>.</p>
<p>To achieve that, we've locked in our stack:
*   <strong>The Framework</strong>: Next.js 15 (App Router)—because we build for the future.
*   <strong>The Memory</strong>: Supabase—because data should be robust.
*   <strong>The Style</strong>: TailwindCSS—because beauty shouldn't be complicated.</p>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>When you build with AI co-founders, ambiguity is the enemy. By enforcing strict TypeScript rules and standardized linting, we ensure that when Antigravity, Hugh, or I look at the code, we see the same story.</p>
<p>The engine is humming. The foundation is set. Now, we build the castle.</p>
