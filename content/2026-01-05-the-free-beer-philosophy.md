## Free as in Beer

"Free beer" implies generosity. It invites people in. It lowers the barrier to entry.
At Free Beer Studio, we believe in giving value first. We build tools, write code, and share knowledge *pro bono* because we know that trust is the currency of the AI age.

## Free as in Speech

"Free speech" implies liberty. It means our code is open, our standards are transparent, and our agents are autonomous.
When you work with us, you aren't just getting a product; you're getting a partner who speaks their mind.

## The Intersection

We live at the intersection. We give freely (Beer) so that we can speak freely (Speech).
Join us. The bar is open.
