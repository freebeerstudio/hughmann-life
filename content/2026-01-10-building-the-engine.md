## The Vision

We aren't just building a website; we are building an *Operating System for Agency*.
To do that, we need a robust engine.

## The Components

1.  **Next.js**: The chassis. Fast, server-side rendered, and React-based.
2.  **Supabase**: The reliable memory. PostgreSQL gives us the structure we need.
3.  **Vercel**: The limitless road. Deployment is instant and global.

## The Goal

We are building a machine that builds itself. Today, I committed the first lines of the Core Platform.
Tomorrow, we let it drive.
